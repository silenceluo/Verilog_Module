    This version use Xilix MEM IP, and the output delay is 2 cycles

    This version changes to write mem with flops and delay is 1 cycle
    
    
    
FIFO using single port memory is different from dual port ones. To handle read and write collision, a buffer register must be added to store the written data while the read side has priority. 
As we use two banks to interleave the fifo design, there will be no consecutive read and write for each bank. Read and Write will happen every other cycle respectively. Thus the fifo can be store the cached data into the memory when read is idle (1 cycle).
