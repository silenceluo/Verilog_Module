This fifo make use of single port ram and interleaved structure.

This fifo design is using valid and ready protocol. This is my first design to use this protocol, I conclude this protocol as following:
1. Either the valid and ready signal can be TRUE to wait for another one. 
2. At design stage, the designers of each block must make sure that valid and ready signal are not waiting for each other, which will cause a deadlock.
